This simple demo uses the Cloud Speech API to recognize what you said, converts it to morse code and uses the LED to "send the message".

The demo requires you to have an AIY Voice Kit, set up according to
the documentation at the [AIY Projects site](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com).

You also need to have [enabled the Cloud Speech API](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/#makers-guide-3-1--change-to-the-cloud-speech-api).

You can then copy the source files from this repo to `/home/pi/AIY-voice-kit-python/src` and run `aiy_speech_2_morse.py` from there.
